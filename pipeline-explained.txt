# Improved OCR Pipeline

1. **Grayscale** - convert to single channel for consistent processing.
2. **Gaussian Blur** - smooth noise to reduce spurious edges.
3. **Canny Edge Detection** - highlight strong edges of the label.
4. **Dilate** - close small gaps in the edges.
5. **Contour Filtering** - find convex quadrilaterals near the expected aspect ratio.
6. **Perspective Warp** - warp the best quad to a fixed size bitmap.
7. **ML Kit Input** - feed the warped bitmap to TextRecognition.
8. **Debug Save** - when Show Crop is used, the warped bitmap is written to
   `cacheDir/warped.jpg` so developers can review the exact image passed to ML
   Kit.
