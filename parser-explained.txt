OcrParser processes lines from ML Kit OCR results:
1. Find the tallest line's bounding box height.
2. Ignore any line shorter than 75% of that height.
3. Replace underscores with spaces.
4. Remove quoted text and content inside brackets.
5. Strip characters except letters, digits, spaces, '-' and '%'.
6. Trim whitespace and return the cleaned strings.
