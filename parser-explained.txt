OcrParser processes lines from ML Kit OCR results:
1. Find the tallest line's bounding box height.
2. Remove any line shorter than 60% of that height.
3. Replace spaces with underscores.
4. Remove quoted text and content inside brackets.
5. Strip characters except letters, digits, spaces, '-', '%', and '/'.
6. Trim whitespace and any character before the whitespace for that line, then return the cleaned strings.
7. Detect roll# line using the line with the most digits, then the tallest line with a known keyword or the line with the most letters becomes the customer.
8. In the roll#, if a underscore is present, remove the all characters before the final underscore as well as the final underscore.
9. Return only `Roll#:<value>` and `Cust-Name:<value>`.
