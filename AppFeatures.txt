# App Features

The project is a minimal Android application written in Kotlin. Below are all of the current features and how they operate.

## 1. Main Activity
* Displays a "Hello World" text view on launch.
* Contains a **Bin Locator** button. When pressed, this launches the `BinLocatorActivity` using an explicit intent.
* Limitations: the main screen only provides navigation to the bin locator and does not contain additional functionality.

## 2. Bin Locator Activity
* Provides a camera preview using **CameraX**. When the screen loads it requests the camera permission if needed and starts the camera.
* Offers a **Rotate** button that cycles the capture rotation by 90 degrees each time it is pressed. This rotation is applied to the next captured image.
* Includes a **Capture** button. When tapped it captures a photo to a temporary file, rotates the image based on the current setting and runs **ML Kit Text Recognition**.
* Shows a green **TOP** label with a bounding box overlay so users align text correctly. The captured image is cropped to this region before processing.
* Supports pinch-to-zoom on the preview with a slider and 1x reset button for precise adjustments.
  In landscape mode the slider turns vertical on the right side with the reset button below it.
* The recognised text is displayed to the user in a simple alert dialog. Errors are printed to logcat.
* Limitations:
  * Orientation changes only affect the captured image, not the preview transformation.
  * Error handling is basic and does not present failures to the user beyond printing stack traces.

## 3. Image Utilities
* `ImageUtils.rotateBitmap()` rotates a bitmap by a specified angle using a `Matrix`. If the angle is a multiple of 360 the input bitmap is returned unmodified.
* Limitations: performs a full bitmap copy which may consume memory for large images.

## 4. Unit and Instrumentation Tests
* Unit tests verify package naming and a rotation helper using **Robolectric** (currently ignored due to missing dependencies in CI).
* Instrumentation tests run on an emulator or device to ensure the Hello World text is shown and the Bin Locator screen launches correctly.
* Limitations: test coverage is minimal and the image rotation test is skipped.

## 5. Helper Scripts
* `decode_gradle_wrapper.py` restores the Gradle wrapper JAR from a base64 encoded file.
* `install_android_sdk.sh` installs the Android SDK commandâ€‘line tools. It uses the bundled archive in the repository when available and prints instructions for setting `ANDROID_HOME`.
* Limitations: a network connection is still required for additional packages if they are not cached locally.

- Uses a MaterialComponents theme defined in styles.xml
