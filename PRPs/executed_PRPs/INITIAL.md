## FEATURE:

-Create an android app usable in android studio by the user and by codex for coding help.
-Codex capable of running tests. (if this requires some user intervention, then it is okay but try to do it all yourself.
-Codex capapble of debugging the app either with user help or preferably not.
-Make sure the app is able to be built and ran in android studio.
-Do not add features to the app yet, we just want it to be able to build, run in an emulator on android studio, and be tested by codex.
